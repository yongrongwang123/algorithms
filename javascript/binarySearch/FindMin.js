/**
 * Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and
 * n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
 * - [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
 * - [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
 * Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results
 * in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]. Given the sorted rotated
 * array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array. You
 * must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 5000
 * -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
 * All the integers of nums are unique.
 * nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
