/**
 * You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, 
 * and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type 
 * of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also 
 * jewels. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of 
 * stone from "A".
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
 * jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
 * All the characters of jewels are unique.
