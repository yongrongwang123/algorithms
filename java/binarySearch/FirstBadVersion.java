/**
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. 
 * Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since 
 * each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after 
 * a bad version are also bad. Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you 
 * want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be 
 * bad. You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version 
 * is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize 
 * the number of calls to the API.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 5, bad = 4
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * call isBadVersion(3) -> false
 * call isBadVersion(5) -> true
 * call isBadVersion(4) -> true
 * Then 4 is the first bad version.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1
