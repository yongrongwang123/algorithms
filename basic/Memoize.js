/**
 * Given a function fn, return a memoized version of that function. A memoized
 * function is a function that will never be called twice with the same inputs.
 * Instead it will return a cached value. You can assume there are 3 possible input
 * functions: sum, fib, and factorial.
 *  - sum accepts two integers a and b and returns a + b. Assume that if a value
 * has already been cached for the arguments (b, a) where a != b, it cannot be
 * used for the arguments (a, b). For example, if the arguments are (3, 2) and
 * (2, 3), two separate calls should be made.
 *  - fib accepts a single integer n and returns 1 if n <= 1 or fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
 * otherwise.
 *  - factorial accepts a single integer n and returns 1 if n <= 1 or
 * factorial(n - 1) * n otherwise.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * fnName = "sum"
 * actions = ["call","call","getCallCount","call","getCallCount"]
 * values = [[2,2],[2,2],[],[1,2],[]]
 * Output: [4,4,1,3,2]
 * Explanation:
 * const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
 * const memoizedSum = memoize(sum);
 * memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. sum() was called as (2, 2) was not
 *                    // seen before.
 * memoizedSum(2, 2); // "call" - returns 4. However sum() was not called because
 *                    // the same inputs were seen before.
 * // "getCallCount" - total call count: 1
 * memoizedSum(1, 2); // "call" - returns 3. sum() was called as (1, 2) was not
 *                    // seen before.
 * // "getCallCount" - total call count: 2
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 0 <= a, b <= 105
 * 1 <= n <= 10
 * 1 <= actions.length <= 105
 * actions.length === values.length
 * actions[i] is one of "call" and "getCallCount"
 * fnName is one of "sum", "factorial" and "fib"
