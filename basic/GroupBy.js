/**
 * Write code that enhances all arrays such that you can call the array.groupBy(fn)
 * method on any array and it will return a grouped version of the array. A grouped
 * array is an object where each key is the output of fn(arr[i]) and each value is
 * an array containing all items in the original array which generate that key. The
 * provided callback fn will accept an item in the array and return a string key.
 * The order of each value list should be the order the items appear in the array.
 * Any order of keys is acceptable. Please solve it without lodash's _.groupBy function.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: 
 * array = [{"id":"1"}, {"id":"1"}, {"id":"2"}], 
 * fn = function (item) { 
 *   return item.id; 
 * }
 * Output: 
 * {"1": [{"id": "1"}, {"id": "1"}], "2": [{"id": "2"}]}
 * Explanation:
 * Output is from array.groupBy(fn). The selector function gets the "id" out of each
 * item in the array. There are two objects with an "id" of 1. Both of those objects
 * are put in the first array. There is one object with an "id" of 2. That object
 * is put in the second array.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 0 <= array.length <= 10^5
 * fn returns a string
